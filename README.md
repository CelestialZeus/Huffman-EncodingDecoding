# Huffman-EncodingDecoding
It is a project on hufman coding which will illustrate the working of huffman coding algorithm with gui 

In this project the basic huffman coding algorithm is done like if we given a string then it will do commpression and will return the huffman table,code
Then we implemented gui too for user friendlyness
Anyone can use our code for their projects 
Any doubts contact us in linkedin
